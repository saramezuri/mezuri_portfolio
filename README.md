<h1>Hi, I am Sara! 

<h2><p> A dedicated and passionate student in Applied Mathematics currently in my fourth year of doctoral studies. My research focus revolves around the dynamic intersection of statistics, data science, and the intricate world of stock markets. With a keen interest in unraveling complex patterns and trends within financial data, I am committed to contributing valuable insights to the realm of portfolio management.</p></h2>

<h2> Projects: </h2>

- <b>[Financial Analysis with Python: A Comprehensive Tutorial](https://github.com/saramezuri/financial-analysis-tutorial-python)</b>
  - Utilize the yfinance library to pull historical stock data for major European indices (EURO STOXX 50, FTSE 100, DAX, CAC40, FTSE MIB, SMI, IBEX 35).
  - Create a Pandas DataFrame for a structured view of the data.
  - Uncover insights through a detailed exploration of data shape, structure, and descriptive statistics.
  - Employ visualization tools such as line charts and candlestick charts to identify trends and anomalies.
  - Conduct a return analysis, calculating average daily returns and identifying best and worst day returns.
  - Explore volatility through the calculation of historical volatility, offering a measure of price fluctuation.
  - Leverage Plotly for creating interactive subplots and distribution plots, enhancing data interpretation.
  - Gain a profound understanding of the financial dynamics of European stock markets during the critical period of 2017-2022, unveiling the impact of global events like the COVID-19 pandemic.
    
- <b>[A Time Series Analysis of General Motors Company Monthly Sales in the US Market](https://github.com/saramezuri/gm-time-series-analysis)</b>
  - The project utilizes monthly sales data for General Motors in the US market. To evaluate model predictions, the most recent 24 months are temporarily excluded, to be added later for comparison.
  - Original time series plots reveal changes in trend and seasonality.
  - Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test assesses stationarity.
  - Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots aid in model selection.
  - Logarithmic transformation stabilizes variance.
  - Differencing stabilizes mean, addressing trend and seasonality.
  - Seasonal differencing at lag 12 identifies yearly seasonality.
  - Identification of SARIMA model using ACF and PACF plots.
  - Code-based model selection considering AIC, SSE, and Ljung-Box test.
  - SARIMA(0,1,2)(0,1,1) model selected.
  - Equation formulation based on parameter values.
  - Diagnostic analysis ensures residuals exhibit white noise characteristics.
  - Time series plot, histogram, QQ plot, and ACF plot validate model fit.
  - Forecasting General Motors' monthly sales for the next 24 months using the SARIMA model.
  
- <b>[Forecasting Hermès Stock Price Using Monte Carlo Methods and Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/saramezuri/stock-forecast-monte-carlo-methods)</b>
  - Create a dataframe with the historical stock prices of Hermès, collected from Investing.com.
  - Utilizing time series analysis techniques, patterns and trends in the historical data are identified.
  - Transform the time series to ensure stationarity, using techniques like logarithmic transformation and differencing.
  - Plot the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions to aid in model selection.
  - The ARIMA(p, d, q) model is applied, with a detailed exploration of identifying the best numerical values for p, d, and q.
  - Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to generate thousands of possible outcomes for forecasted prices. Factors such as market volatility, industry trends, and economic indicators are considered in the simulations.
  - Expected returns are calculated for different scenarios, incorporating the risk-free rate and investment horizon.
  - The Sharpe Ratio and Value at Risk (VaR) are calculated to assess risk-adjusted returns and potential financial losses.
